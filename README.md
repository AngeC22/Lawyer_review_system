# Lawyer Review System

Lawyer Review System
This is the README file for the Lawyer Review System project, which aims to provide users with the ability to view a list of lawyers based on location and specialty, as well as add ratings for lawyers to share their experiences and help others make informed decisions. The project is built using React, Express, API endpoints, and utilizes the yarn package manager for installation and development.

User Stories
User Story 1: Viewing Lawyers Based on Location and Specialty
As a user, I want to be able to view a list of lawyers based on location and specialty so that I can find the right lawyer for my legal needs.

Acceptance Criteria:

When I visit the application's homepage, I should see a search form.
The search form should include input fields for location and specialty.
After entering the location and specialty, I should be able to submit the form.
Upon form submission, the application should display a list of lawyers based on the provided location and specialty.
Each lawyer in the list should display their name, specialty, rating, and contact information.
The list of lawyers should be sorted by their rating in descending order.
If no lawyers match the given location and specialty, a message should be displayed indicating that no results were found.
User Story 2: Adding Ratings for Lawyers
As a user, I want to be able to add ratings for lawyers so that I can share my experience and help others make informed decisions.

Acceptance Criteria:

When viewing a lawyer's profile, there should be a section to add a rating.
The rating section should include a rating scale (e.g., from 1 to 5 stars) and a comment box.
I should be able to select a rating by clicking on the appropriate star.
After selecting a rating and entering a comment, I should be able to submit the rating.
Upon submission, the rating should be added to the lawyer's profile and displayed along with the existing ratings.
The lawyer's overall rating should be updated to reflect the new rating.
The rating form should validate that a rating value is selected and a comment is provided before allowing submission.
